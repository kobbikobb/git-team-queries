# A simple git team reporting tools

Usage:
Create a file called users.txt in the root of this project and add a line for each username
Create a file called repos.txt in the root of this project and add a line for each repository path

Example:
users.txt
john
mike

repos.txt
/Users/mike/code/awesome/.git

NOTE:
Add a extra enter in the end of each of those config files

This is work in progress, I might change this a lot
